501,"[3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 1, 5]","1. We have then the primitive arrangement of the earth’s surface adapted to his blissful estate, as not existent but designed. 2. The force of this idea was much weakened, however, by the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal and unadapted to any purpose. 3. I repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation, and that, therefore, her susceptibility of improvement at this one point, was a mystery I had been unable to solve. 4. He thus explained:—Admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the first intention. 5. The disturbances were the preparations for his subsequently conceived deathful condition. 6. It was Ellison who suggested that they were prognostic of death. 7. My own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would have so arranged the earth’s surface as to have fulfilled at all points man’s sense of perfection in the beautiful, the sublime, or the picturesque; but that this primitive intention had been frustrated by the known geological disturbances—disturbances of form and color—grouping, in the correction or allaying of which lies the soul of art. "
505,"[1, 7, 4, 6, 2, 8, 3, 5, 9]","1. “The author’s observations on the artificial style,” continued Ellison, “are less objectionable. 2. There may be an object in keeping with the principle—an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by individuals, yet which, if attained, would lend a charm to the landscape-garden far surpassing that which a sense of merely human interest could bestow. 3. It will be seen that, in bringing about such result, he secures all the advantages of interest or design, while relieving his work of the harshness or technicality of the worldly art. 4. This is just; as also is the reference to the sense of human interest. 5. In the most rugged of wildernesses—in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature—there is apparent the art of a creator; yet this art is apparent to reflection only; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling. 6. The principle expressed is incontrovertible—but there may be something beyond it. 7. A mixture of pure art in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty. 8. A poet, having very unusual pecuniary resources, might, while retaining the necessary idea of art or culture, or, as our author expresses it, of interest, so imbue his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty, as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference. 9. Now let us suppose this sense of the Almighty design to be one step depressed—to be brought into something like harmony or consistency with the sense of human art—to form an intermedium between the two:—let us imagine, for example, a landscape whose combined vastness and definitiveness—whose united beauty, magnificence, and strangeness, shall convey the idea of care, or culture, or superintendence, on the part of beings superior, yet akin to humanity—then the sentiment of interest is preserved, while the art intervolved is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature—a nature which is not God, nor an emanation from God, but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and God.” "
563,"[2, 1, 3]","1. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation. 2. In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found us occupied very nearly as before. 3. At length I said,— "
618,"[2, 1, 5, 3, 4, 6]","1. For some seconds I dared not open them—while I expected instant destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles with the water. 2. “As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes. 3. I still lived. 4. The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt of foam, with the exception that she now lay more along. 5. But moment after moment elapsed. 6. I took courage, and looked once again upon the scene. "
621,"[7, 2, 6, 5, 1, 3, 8, 4]","1. I now began to watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in our company. 2. Both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves. 3. I must have been delirious, for I even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative velocities of their several descents toward the foam below. 4. At length, after making several guesses of this nature, and being deceived in all—this fact—the fact of my invariable miscalculation, set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more. 5. It appeared to grow upon me as I drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom. 6. I have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors. 7. “Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl. 8. ‘This fir tree,’ I found myself at one time saying, ‘will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears,’—and then I was disappointed to find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before. "
666,"[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]",1. Down—steadily down it crept. 2. To the right—to the left—far and wide—with the shriek of a damned spirit! 3. I took a frenzied pleasure in contrasting its downward with its lateral velocity. 4. I alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant. 5. to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger! 
669,"[10, 3, 7, 4, 11, 6, 9, 2, 5, 1, 8]","1. Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast. 2. Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility? 3. For the first time during many hours—or perhaps days—I thought. 4. I was tied by no separate cord. 5. Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? 6. But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel! 7. It now occurred to me that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. 8. The surcingle enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions—save in the path of the destroying crescent. 9. The result of the slightest struggle how deadly! 10. I saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe, and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen, collected calmness of despair. 11. The first stroke of the razorlike crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand. "
681,"[5, 6, 1, 7, 2, 4, 3]","1. I was especially fond of animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets. 2. This peculiarity of character grew with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure. 3. There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man. 4. To those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable. 5. From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of my disposition. 6. My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions. 7. With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them. "
